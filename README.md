# 💻 Chat Frontend - Angular + WebSocket

This is the frontend of a simple real-time chat application built with **Angular**. It uses **WebSockets** to provide live two-way communication between clients without refreshing the page.


This project was created as my first **usage of WebSockets** to learn the basics of real-time communication in full-stack applications. 🚀

> 💡 You can find the backend here: [Chat Backend](https://github.com/AlejoAmaris03/websocket-chat-backend)
